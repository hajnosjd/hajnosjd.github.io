      <h2><a class="bold">Ye</a> (/jeɪ/ YAY; born <a class="bold">Kanye Omari West</a>; June 8, 1977), commonly known as <a class="bold">Kanye West</a> (/ˈkɑːnjeɪ/ KAHN-yay), is an American rapper, record producer, and fashion designer.[3][4][5][6] Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West gained recognition as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing singles for several artists and developing the "chipmunk soul" sampling style. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, he released his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), to critical and commercial success and subsequently founded the record label GOOD Music. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential hip-hop musicians of all time, and one of the most critically acclaimed artists of his generation.[citation needed]

West explored diverse musical elements such as orchestral arrangements, synthesizers, and autotune on the albums Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and 808s & Heartbreak (2008). Drawing inspiration from maximalism and minimalism respectively, his fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) and sixth album Yeezus (2013) were also released to critical and commercial success. West further diversified his musical styles on The Life of Pablo (2016) and Ye (2018), and explored Christian and gospel music on Jesus Is King (2019). After a series of delays, his highly anticipated tenth album Donda (2021) was released to mixed critical reception. He released its sequel, Donda 2, a few months later, exclusive to his STEM player. West's discography also includes the full-length collaborative albums Watch the Throne (2011) with Jay-Z and Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Kid Cudi.

<h2>
West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant media coverage. He has been a frequent source of controversy for his conduct on social media, at award shows, and in public settings, and his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, race, and slavery. His Christian faith, marriage to Kim Kardashian, and his mental health have also been sources of further media attention.[7][8] As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, The Gap, and A.P.C. on clothing and footwear, and leads the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas. He is also the founder and head of the creative content company Donda. In 2020, West launched an unsuccessful independent presidential campaign that primarily advocated for a consistent life ethic.[9][10]
